This\ntendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure\ngains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally\ndiscard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency,\ncalled the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is\npresented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is devcloped, in which value\nis assigned to gains and losses rathcr than to final assets and in which probabilities are\nreplaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for guins, commonly\nconvex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are\ngenerally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low prob-\nabilities.
