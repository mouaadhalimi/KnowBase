Leaders of innovation create organizations where people are willing and
able to do the work of innovation, where everyone has the opportunity
to contribute his or her slice of genius to the collective genius of the
whole.
That may seem obvious, but most of those in positions of authority
have been taught a concept of leadership that actually stifles innovation.
They think their job is to come up with the big ideas and mobilize people to
execute them. Somehow they see themselves as the ones who make innovation
happen. But this approach makes no sense when the goal is the creation
of something original. In that setting, no one can know in advance, by
definition, what the outcome will be, not even the leader.1
Consequently, many leaders who truly seek to foster innovation must
start by abandoning the “Follow me! I know the way!” approach that many consider
the core role of leadership. They need to replace it with a different mindset
about how leaders foster innovation from everyone in their organization.

In this chapter, we will look at Vineet Nayar. As president and then
CEO of HCL Technologies (HCL)—with tens of thousands of employees, a
much larger company than Pixar—he led the transformation of a faltering
Indian computer company into a dynamic global provider of innovative IT
Â�services. In him we will see a leader who used his authority to take actions
far Â�different from those of a conventional CEO. He exemplified the kind of
leadership needed to create an organization where people are willing and
able to innovate.2
A New Leader for HCL
“We don’t need a Band-Aid; what we need is a tourniquet!” Nayar was sitting
at his desk in the Delhi headquarters of HCL. On a dusty street outside,
hoards of cattle, motorbikes, chauffeured town cars, trucks, and pedestrians
battled for right of way. The air was thick and wavy with heat and the
Â�nonstop honking and bleating of horns.
To Nayar, the bedlam outside mirrored the chaos inside his company.
It was April 5, 2005, his first day as HCL’s president. As far as first days
go, this was a bad one. It was early afternoon when he learned that two
Â�customers wanted to cancel engagements. Unfortunately, this was not a
Â�surprise.
A pioneer of the Indian computer industry, HCL, part of the HCL
Enterprise, had grown into a company with $764 million in revenues, a
market cap of $2.3 billion, and twenty-four thousand employees. Once one
of India’s most innovative companies, it had slipped in recent years to number
five in revenue among its Indian counterparts. Still growing at a cumulative
rate of 35 percent, though more slowly than most competitors, it was
living off its past reputation and customer base. More ominous, employee
turnover was high, the company no longer attracted the best talent, and the
market was growing even more competitive each year.
A classic start-up founded in 1976 in an Indian garage by Shiv Nadar,
HCL Enterprise flourished in the 1980s—“a golden period” for the company,
said an employee. But the seeds of change were also being planted in
that decade. The personal computer appeared. Open source systems began
to replace proprietary systems. Most important, focus in the industry was
moving to software from hardware, which was increasingly a commodity.
Recasting the Role of the Leader
47
This was the period when Indian software companies rose to Â�prominence,
including such firms as Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), and
Â�Infosys.
In spite of these changes, HCL Enterprise entered the 1990s determined
to retain its focus on hardware. But by the end of the century,
founder Shiv Nadar realized the need to expand HCL Enterprise’s strategic
focus to include software. In 1998, he split HCL into two companies:
HCL Â�Infosystems, an Indian-facing firm focused on hardware and on
Â�software integration; and HCL Technologies, a global IT services company
that provided software-led IT solutions, remote infrastructure management
Â�services, and business process outsourcing.
By 2004, the Indian IT industry had estimated annual revenues of $36
billion and was growing rapidly. HCL struggled to keep up. Services were
“the new game,” said an HCL employee, “and we entered late.” Building a
brand as a services company was not easy, given HCL Enterprise’s legacy as
the number-one producer of hardware in India. Customers wanted experienced
outsourcers that could provide real business value, not just hardware
and low-cost commodity work.
Nayar’s upbringing helped prepare him for his demanding new role.
Because his father died when he was young, “the traditional command-andcontrol
structure did not exist in our household,” he said. As a result, he
grew up less imbued than most in his culture with a reverence for hierarchy
and formal authority.
Nayar joined HCL Enterprise in 1985 as a twenty-three-year-old
Â�engineer with an MBA and soon established a strong reputation as a top talent.
As he made his way up through various managerial positions, he clearly
saw what was happening to the company, and his beliefs about leadership
evolved. “I was often asked lots of questions by my employees,” he said.
At first, I loved it. I enjoyed being looked up to. It made me feel important
and successful. But very slowly, I began to see this style of management
had its limitations. I could never know enough about everything
happening in our company. Sometimes I gave answers that proved to
be wrong and caused people trouble. Sometimes I gave answers and
the people who had asked the questions ignored what I said … I had a
Collective Genius
48
sense that there must be a better way to manage a company. I decided
in order to find out what it was, that I would have to leave HCL and
start my own enterprise and make it a very different kind of company. It
would have little hierarchy, be highly creative, and fast moving.
When Shiv Nadar heard of Nayar’s plans, he proposed an alternative:
become an entrepreneur within HCL Enterprise. The Indian government at
the time wanted to create a new stock exchange. Nayar realized that developing
a more reliable and transparent electronic exchange using satellitebased
technology was an attractive opportunity. He accepted the challenge,
hired a few colleagues, and in 1993 founded Comnet, an IT infrastructure
and networking business wholly owned by HCL Enterprise.
Nayar and his fellow Comnetians spent two years developing a
Â�proposal for using satellite technology to modernize the stock exchange,
something never done before. “We were battling the best in the world,” said
an early Comnetian, “and the stakes were so high we had to be innovative.”
Comnet won the deal and navigated huge logistical challenges to open the
National Stock Exchange in November 1994.
By the late 1990s, Nayar had earned a reputation as an Â�exceptional
leader who had made Comnet one of HCL Enterprise’s most agile,
Â�innovative, and successful businesses. With close to a thousand employees,
Â�Comnet had won many high-profile deals. “At heart we were all entrepreneurs,”
said Anant Gupta, then Comnet’s chief operating officer, “and we
were constantly transforming our business to adapt to market dynamics.”
Regular transformation was a core part of Comnet’s culture. As Nayar
said, “We believed that if we did not innovate every eighteen months or so,
if we did not bring a new product or service to the market, we would not
remain competitive and would lose our position as market leader.” In 2002,
the company successfully went global and opened offices in eleven countries.
Comnet’s growth surged through the 1990s and early 2000s, while
HCL continued to lose ground to competitors. Shiv Nadar began looking
for new leadership for HCL and offered the presidency to the young leader
of Comnet. Nayar hesitated. He knew the difference between building a
successful start-up and turning around a large, declining firm. He finally
accepted with one condition: “that I could do things my way. I wanted to
Recasting the Role of the Leader
49
make drastic changes that had never been made before. It was risky but
Shiv said okay.”
Nayar spent the following weeks visiting dozens of customers and
HCL offices in India, the United States, China, and Europe. Immersing
himself in the company revealed the true gravity of its problems. Customers
continued to be unhappy and threatened to cancel; new business was coming
in at a trickle; attrition had risen to more than 20 percent. “I had been
running my own little shop inside HCL,” he said, “and didn’t realize how
much the company had slipped in the past few years. Within a few weeks,
IÂ€stopped being polite.”
Nayar Understood the Market Had Shifted
When he took over the leadership at HCL, Nayar knew that the role of IT in
most major companies was changing. Not only was it central to their operational
success, it had become transformational, capable of changing their
businesses in strategic ways. However, he saw greater opportunity than
merely joining the throng offering software and services in response to this
shift. He wanted HCL to become a full partner with clients in harnessing
the transformative potential of IT.
Nayar thought about this in terms of where value for the customer was
created. In the old HCL—in fact, in all traditional companies that sold actual
products—it resided mostly in those who created products. The “value
zone,” as he called the place where value was created for the customer, had
essentially been inside the company and that had been where innovation
was most needed.
Becoming a services company, especially one that aspired to transform
clients with innovative IT solutions, shifted the value zone. In the
new HCL, it would reside at the outer edge of the company where HCL
people worked with the customer to solve the customer’s problems and ultimately
to transform its business. In short, the new value zone would be
the Â�relationship between HCL people and the customer. That was where the
new HCL would most need innovation, not inside but on the edge, at the
interface with customers.
Nayar saw the possibilities that this new way of thinking offered. He
saw that HCL’s competitors were far ahead in offering basic IT services
Collective Genius
50
beyond hardware, but none was yet working with customers to apply the full
potential of IT. He saw here an opportunity to leapfrog competitors by moving
even further up the value chain and focusing on larger, more complex,
and transformative engagements. That market space would still be uncontested,
especially if HCL could combine its new approach with its traditional
Indian focus on low cost and value.
The Real Problem
Seizing the opportunity would be difficult. To become a transformative
partner for its customers, HCL would have to undergo its own transformation.
Nayar needed an organization focused on this new value zone,
and, he would have to create one not from scratch, as he had at Comnet,
but from a traditional organization designed to support a traditional
value zone inside the company. The new value zone would require creation
of value in a long-term partnership with the customer. And that
would require an organization in which innovation came not from management
and a few product designers, but bottom up from people in the
“zone,” to use Nayar’s term for it, who were willing and able to innovate
continuously.
His challenge was that these employees and the organization
Â�supporting them had never been asked to do any of this before. During
those intense early weeks when he traveled to company offices around the
world, he discovered that too many employees were complacent and reactive.
TheyÂ€didn’t share their ideas, let alone debate them with one another,
and they weren’tÂ€taking responsibility for company performance. Above all,
they weren’t willing to innovate to meet customers’ increasingly complex
and strategic needs. They expected management to set direction and come
up with new ideas.
However, Nayar knew he couldn’t blame the employees for these
attitudes and behaviors. At HCL, as in many companies, managers often
focused on setting direction and making sure no one deviated from it, so traditionally
people tended to look upward for instructions, which hampered
self-driven innovative problem solving. The HCL organization, he realized,
was “shackling people and keeping them from contributing all they could
and in the ways they longed to.”
Recasting the Role of the Leader
51
The fundamental obstacle in the way of his hopes and plans for the new
HCL was how people were being led. It was the employees themselves that
HCL was offering to customers. “The value zone was between the employees
and the customers, not me and the customers,” said Nayar. “Without
that employee value zone, and the value created there by innovative employees,
HCL was nothing but a shell—layers and layers of Â�management.”
“It’s laughable,” he added. “Can you imagine a company with only
senior managers? Management would not be able to deliver innovative solutions
to customers. We had to find a way to put the value zone at the center
of the company.”
Early Steps
Nayar knew he had to act quickly, and so one of his first steps was to halt people’s
ability to keep doing things the old way. He realized that small engagements
with limited scope and duration could not serve as vehicles for the kind of value
he wanted HCL to create for customers. In early July, three months after joining
HCL, he convened a three-day meeting—called the Blueprint Â�meeting—of the
company’s top one hundred managers. There he announced a new operational
strategy. HCL would stop going after the small, project-based work that constituted
much of what it was currently doing, and, instead, it would pursue big
deals. To do that, he told the group, they needed to differentiate HCL by offering
“multiservice, unique propositions that transform Â�customers’ businesses.”
They were going to start competing against global majors like Accenture and
IBM, “so it was critical that we get our house in order.”
To make this new direction real, he set out a tangible challenge. By
chance, a major European electronics retailer, DSGi, had just emerged as an
opportunity. It was seeking a vendor to which it could outsource its internal
IT support. Putting together a proposal would take months, Nayar said, but
it, “could turn around everything for HCL. It could be a rallying point and
IÂ€thought we should go after it.”
To support this new direction, he took a number of other steps. He
restructured the company around lines of business, rather than geographic
areas. He pushed to automate consistent systems and processes across all
lines of business and worldwide, so all employees would receive timely and
consistent information. He fostered the development of an extensive talent
Collective Genius
52
development program that linked business goals to the individual learning
needs of each employee.
He paid particular attention to reviving the Sales and Delivery groups
because, when he arrived, he’d inherited a demoralized sales team that was
accustomed to losing. The new head of Sales, a transplant from Comnet,
reorganized the group around vertical markets and installed new sales tools,
incentives, and programs to encourage and support megadeal wins.
He created a Business Finance group that worked with Sales and
Delivery to make sure every deal was a financial win for both HCL and the
customer. To make sure HCL could start delivering right away on big deals,
he created the Multi-Service Delivery Unit and staffed it with two hundred
technical people, all selected through a rigorous process that considered not
only technical but business and social skills as well. This elite group focused
exclusively on winning and then helping deliver large, exclusive deals like
the one HCL wanted with DSGi.
Nayar pushed through these and other changes. Operating with a real
sense of urgency, he put in place the organizational structures and tools that
would foster the innovation HCL needed to win and deliver on big deals.
Though important and necessary, however, such steps by themselves
would not create the kind of organization Nayar wanted. He could not take it
by fiat where it needed to go. He could use the power of the CEO’s office to
reorganize and mandate new systems and processes, but he could not direct
employees to innovate. Nor could he tell HCL managers simply to change
the way they managed. That would require a different approach.
As Nayar pondered this challenge, a radical idea occurred to him.
“WhatÂ€if,” he said, “we turned everything upside down? What if management
were accountable to the value zone and the people in it? What if we could put
employees first?” As he thought of it, HCL would have only three components:
the value zone where HCL people interacted with customers, enabling
functions that supported the zone and those in it, and, last, Â�management.
Changing How People Think
In July 2005, three months after he became president, Nayar set up a team
of about thirty young employees to work on this idea. He called them “Young
Sparks” and installed them in offices on the same floor as the Â�executive suite
Recasting the Role of the Leader
53
at HCL headquarters in a Delhi suburb. He met with the group frequently as
it planned the launch of an internal campaign aimed at fostering employee
engagement around the value zone. “I wanted to change how employees
experienced HCL,” he said, “and I knew it needed a brand.”
The Young Sparks’ mandate was to develop a tagline and an intranet
portal on the theme “Employees First.” After much deliberation, and tests
of various logos and phrases that tried to capture the spirit of the new HCL,
“We came up with ‘Employees First, Customers Second,’” said a member
of the group, “because it had shock value and showed we were doing something
radical.”
The group also sought an icon that would symbolize the importance
of the individual and the power of the collective. It settled on Thambi, which
meant “brother” in Tamil, the major language in southern India. Symbolizing
an extraordinary individual with pride, passion, and a focus on results,
Thambi was meant to remind people that they were all members of the same
community and that behind Thambi stood the entire organization, an idea
captured in an HCL slogan: “The Force of One.” Every employee could bring
the full resources of the company to bear on a customer’s problems.
Nayar loved what the Young Sparks had conceived. Thambi Â�symbolized
the HCL employee who could innovate in the value zone. By the end of
July 2005, the group had launched a campaign that introduced “HCLites,”
as they decided to call HCL employees, to “Employees First, Customers
Â�Second” (EFCS).
Some Indian and non-Indian employees were skeptical at first. “Most
of us took a wait-and-see approach,” said one. Another noted, “At the Blueprint
[meeting], it had been made clear to us how broken HCL was. Having
something called ‘Employees First, Customers Second’ to fix us seemed
inadequate.”
Nayar kept stressing, though, that EFCS was in truth “hard not soft.”
Because the customer-employee interface was where value was created, he
said, “I want value-focused employees who are willing and able to drive
an innovative, sophisticated experience for our customers.” EFCS was
about “investing in employees’ development, unleashing their potential to
Â�produce significant bottom-line results. The ultimate goal was to radically
change the business model,” said Nayar.
Collective Genius
54
EFCS was how Nayar talked about making the organization serve those
employees who, directly or indirectly, created value for customers through
innovation in the value zone. Though it attracted much attention inside and
outside the company, it was only one of several ways he sought to undertake
what he called “inverting the organizational pyramid” (see figure 3-1).
Inverting the pyramid was about flipping the organization—customers
at the top, management at the bottom—and putting in place structures for
change so that the focus was clearly on serving the value zone and those in it.
For employees to take responsibility, Nayar believed, the company had
to demonstrate its trust in them in a variety of ways. He called these efforts
“Trust through transparency—creating the culture for change.” He knew
mutual trust was important because it would enable a level of candor and
honest two-way dialogue that let people feel free to speak their minds without
fear. Trust would enable people to accept his interventions without feeling
unduly or unfairly controlled, while candor would let people push back
if they felt the interventions were becoming intrusive.
One notable effort was something HCL called “trust pay,” which
applied to the 85 percent of employees, mostly junior engineers, who weren’t
senior managers or salespeople. “In the industry, it was typical for engineers
to get 70 percent of their pay fixed, and then have 30 percent variable,” said
the head of HR. “But many companies set internal targets so high that only
a small portion of that 30 percent was ever attained. So rather than telling
Figure 3-1â•‡ Inverting the Organizational Pyramid
Recasting the Role of the Leader
55
our employees their fixed pay was Rs. 14,000 per month and variable could
be up to Rs. 6,000 per month, we just gave them the full Rs.Â€20,000.” It did
increase the company’s cost base, Nayar said, “but the idea was, we’d pay
you fully, but we trusted that you would deliver. It reenergized the Â�company,
as suddenly people from the competition were joining us.”
Above all, Nayar believed that the biggest driver of trust was
Â�transparency, and many of his actions were aimed at making the company
and its management more open. HCL began using its intranet much more
extensively as a lively, personalized place where employees could get almost
all the information and processes they needed to do their jobs. The intranet
made that information more timely, consistent, and transparent. It was a key
way to communicate with people about EFCS. And, with weekly polls, it was
a useful way to gather data from employees.
Transparency meant more candor about the condition of the company.
Through an initiative he called “Mirror, Mirror,” Nayar held up a metaphorical
mirror when he interacted with employees that revealed HCL had been
“pretty for twenty-five years” but hadn’t been for the past five. He wanted
people to abandon their “it’s okay to lose” mind-set, set their sights higher,
and then take responsibility for change. “There was no soft landing for anyone,”
he said. “I was holding up a mirror to the entire company. We had to
transform from the inside out, and I was hoping that the employees really
wanted to do the same—they just needed to know how!”
The Smart Service Desk (SSD) was an online system brought over
from Comnet. Similar to a help desk, it allowed employees to log in and raise
issues or questions about almost anything related to work—HR, finance, IT,
training, and so on. The system issued a ticket, and the employee could
then track the process of resolving the issue. What made SSD different was
that only the employee could declare a ticket closed and the issue resolved.
Its purpose was to give employees a sense of empowerment through their
Â�ability to raise a problem and follow it to resolution. An issue was an issue
so long as the employee felt it was unresolved.
“U & I” was an online channel Nayar created where employees could
ask him any question they wanted. He answered a hundred questions each
week, and all questions and answers were posted and open to all employees.
Employees asked so many questions that HCL had to dedicate a staff member
Collective Genius
56
to opening, uploading, and categorizing them. Nayar spent hours answering
them himself. “I threw open the door and invited criticism,” he said. “We
were becoming honest, and that was the sign of a healthy company.”
“Directions” meetings were annual events where Nayar and senior
managers traveled to all HCL locations and held face-to-face town hall
Â�discussions. Nayar spent over half his time traveling to the company’s global
locations. “Directions created a common language across the company,” he
said, “so that everyone knew and could articulate what HCL stood for, what
were its key strategies and how they fit into the big picture.”
One employee commented that communications at HCL were once
“handed down from on high,” but Nayar replaced that with much more
direct contact through video conferencing, online tools, and face-to-face
talks. “In the UK,” said this employee, “we frequently gathered in a room
to watch Nayar speaking somewhere in the world. We had a sense of clarity
about where we were headed.”
Trust-building transparency also meant greater openness about
Â�performance. Nayar had the company install a balanced scorecard system
using automated project portals to keep track of work on specific customer
projects. Project performance and customer profitability on every project
were completely visible to all project managers.
Another of Nayar’s actions that provoked much attention was
360-degree reviews. In August, four months after he became president, he
announced that by September all managers would receive 360-degree feedback.
Nayar stressed that this process was for development, not evaluation.
He explained that Comnet had used the approach successfully for the previous
five years. He also announced that he would post his own feedback on
the intranet for all HCL employees to see and even promised to resign if his
360-degree review dipped below a certain level. One of his early reviews said
he was a “tough taskmaster.” He said he wouldn’t require his senior managers
to post their reviews, but he asked for volunteers, and more followed his
example than he had anticipated.
Nayar was pleased with the process: “When the thirty-seven thousand
employees all over the world had the chance to view their top management
transparently, I think the message really got across for the first time that we
were truly a different company. The transformation process was becoming
Recasting the Role of the Leader
57
less dictatorial and more consultative.” As an executive noted, “With the
360’s, there was a tipping point. For a while there were few believers, and
then suddenly there were few nonbelievers.”
Clearly, as Nayar promised, EFCS and “inverting the pyramid” were
not about free lunches. They placed heavy expectations on employees. It was
actually a reworking of the psychological contract—the set of Â�expectations,
most unwritten, between leadership and employees—that shifted the power
dynamic in the company and responsibility for change toward employees.
The message was clear. Leaders at HCL were accountable to employees.
Some managers, scared off by transparency and loss of control, left the
Â�company.
By September 2006, when Nayar and his top managers hosted Directions
meetings for the second time, they were hearing different questions
from people. “During the first year,” he said, “the questions were more
transactional. Employees from all levels were asking about the future, about
strategy, and how to add value. You could tell this was an organization
undergoing transformation.”
Recasting the Role of the Leader
Yet, even after Nayar installed all these changes, HCL essentially remained
a centralized organization. Nayar had been named CEO in 2007, a position,
he realized, that was still the sun of the organizational solar system:
Everywhere I went I got questions—all good and useful questions about
important topics, but it bothered me that I was expected to have all the
answers. It was just that they’d gotten into the habit so common in traditional
Indian companies—and corporations around the world: ask the
executive. What bothered me was that I knew I didn’t have the answers
to their questions—but they probably did.
He wanted employees to accept much more responsibility. To do that,
he decided he had to reframe the role of the CEO in people’s minds, so they
would stop thinking of it as the key driver of change. “Only in that way,” he
said, “could we continue to focus on the value zone, put employees first as
our company continued to gain size and scope, and make the change truly
sustainable.”
Collective Genius
58
He modified the “U & I” online portal he had set up where any
employee could ask him questions. The portal, he realized, did make senior
management more transparent, but it also reinforced the notion of the
all-knowing CEO—the one with the answers—which was exactly what he
wanted to change.
Why shouldn’t the question asking go both ways? He had many
Â�problems he was struggling to solve. Why not ask employees? He created
within “U & I” a section called “My Problems.” There he asked employees
strategic questions he couldn’t solve. “I got incredible answers,” he said.
“Everybody was willing to help their poor, benighted CEO!” He wanted to
shift ownership of HCL away from him to the employees. In effect, he was
telling employees, in his words, “I have no idea how to run this company.
That’s your job.”
In July 2006, all employees went through a new, automated 360-degree
review process. This time, fifteen hundred managers posted their reviews.
While the experience was once again generally positive, some managers still
declined to share their feedback. Later, Nayar began requiring that all managers
post their reviews.
Employees First Councils were voluntary, online employee communities
that formed around different areas of common interest. Subjects ranged
from art and music to corporate social responsibility, but most were focused
on ways to delight customers. They were “if only we could” projects that
would truly differentiate HCL’s offerings in the marketplace. The councils,
each with an elected representative in each office, caught on like wildfire.
Eventually, there were twenty-five hundred council leaders around the world.
Impressed with the councils’ popularity, HCL added some that focused
specifically on business-related passions, such as a particular technology or
line of business. These new communities quickly began to generate a variety
of ideas and helped HCL develop plans and proposals for new business.
One initiative that grew out of these communities was business-aligned IT,
or BAIT. The goal of BAIT was to align HCL’s services much more closely
and quickly with customers’ specific business processes. After a pilot, the
company rolled out the full program over the course of a few months.
“When some of these ideas began to produce new revenue,” Nayar
said, “we realized we had stumbled on another unanticipated benefit: cre-
Recasting the Role of the Leader
59
ating new business ideas through unstructured innovation.” These were
“communities of passion,” he said, “built around personal interests and
business issues.” They helped transfer responsibility for innovation from
leadership to “communities of people collaborating and creating alternatives
outside the boundaries of hierarchy.”
In 2009, Nayar added an element of crowdsourcing to the way HCL
did business planning. Until then, his top three hundred managers had
presented their business plans to the senior team, but he began to wonder if
he should be the one reviewing all those plans. What did he know about the
businesses of these three hundred managers? He wasn’t in the value zone;
they were. It would be better, he thought, if the managers shared their plans
and experiences with each other, perhaps triggering new ideas or solutions
for their respective business areas. Nayar hoped to transform the planning
process from one dominated by top-down judgments to one characterized
by peer-to-peer review.
In spite of some resistance by his senior managers, Nayar created a
portal called “My Blueprint,” where HCL managers posted their plans for
open review by eight thousand other managers above and below them in
the company. The effect, he recalled, was astonishing. First, he was surprised
to find that the managers’ plans sounded very different from the
face-to-face presentations he had been hearing. The depth of analysis and
quality of strategic thinking improved because, he suspected, the managers
knew their own teams and their peers would be reviewing them.
The managers were also more honest in their assessment of current challenges
and opportunities, and they talked less about what they hoped to
accomplish and more about the actions they intended to take to achieve
specific results.
The HCL intranet started buzzing about the plans on My Blueprint.
Knowledge sharing increased well beyond Nayar’s initial hopes. People
helped each other refine their plans. Many managers found the postings
far more relevant and actionable than the information they’d previously
received in briefings from their superiors. Managers found they had far
more buy-in from their teams. “In the end,” Nayar said, “the leadership
team and I participated in the process, giving comments and feedback, but
our voices were just a few among eight thousand.”
Collective Genius
60
Nayar launched “iGen,” a limited-time online platform that followed
the annual face-to-face Directions meetings. Employees could propose
solutions there to problems HCL faced. Far more than another electronic
suggestion box, iGen required a well-thought-out idea with supporting
information and suggestions for execution, along with predictions for
cost savings or impact on the company. The iGen application guided
an employee through the process with ten questions. “The exact ideas
employees proposed,” Nayar said, “were not as important, usually, as the
fact that they were thinking creatively. iGen was about the culture of creating
ideas.”
HCLites Become Innovative Problem Solvers
Because of all those changes, something fundamental began to happen at
HCL, something on which the big, long-term deals would depend for ultimate
success. HCL employees were beginning to innovate bottom up in the value
zone. The following example is one of hundreds and, ultimately, thousands.
An HCL employee working with a global pharma customer noticed
while reading some of its business reports that the pharmaceutical company
had developed a vaccine for cervical cancer. On his own, the employee
decided to start organizing communications events for women at HCL
where they could learn about the disease and the vaccine and, if they chose,
be vaccinated. It was not necessarily easy to set up. The HR department,
among others, had many reasonable questions. Why should we do this? Is
it safe? Has it been tested? He pushed through the barriers, created with his
work team of programmers an outreach system for organizing and holding
an event, and eventually was able to run an event where HCL subsidized
vaccinations for fifteen hundred women employees.
Around this time, the CIO of the pharma customer was in India
and by chance saw a poster in an HCL cafeteria publicizing the event. He
brought up the program with the business side of HCL, which realized this
outreach program, already designed, could readily be taken to market as
a service. The program turned into one of the early components of HCL’s
emerging Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) business. The outreach program
expanded to serve not only women concerned about cervical cancer
but also patients with diabetes. It also became both a way for the pharma
Recasting the Role of the Leader
61
customer to expand sales and a BPO service that HCL could offer pharma
companies for use in emerging markets.
As one HCL manager, who worked extensively with this pharma
Â�customer, said, “This was one little innovation, but when you imagine tens
of thousands of people doing this every day, it can add up.”
Progress
Six months after Nayar first announced the big deals strategy at the first
Blueprint meeting, HCL won the $330 million DSGi deal that he had set
as a goal. It surpassed the previous record for India’s largest outsourcing
deal, set by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) with a $250 million contract in
2005.3 Many employees had been skeptical that HCL could win something
so big against the global majors, especially while it was undergoing its own
transformation. Said Nayar, “We really chased this deal. In the past we’d let
big deals get away, but we said, ‘Not this one.’”
DSGi was only one of several big deals that started coming in. The
first, a $50 million, multiyear contract with Autodesk, a California-based
software and services company, came in before DSGi. Next came a strategic
$100 million partnership with EXA Corporation, a Japanese system
Â�integrator that was a joint venture between IBM Japan and JFE Steel, Japan’s
Â�second-largest steel manufacturer. These were “the type of work we wanted,”
said Nayar, “complex, long-term, and multimillion.” More followed, with
Teradyne, a leading supplier of automatic test equipment based in Boston;
with Cisco, the networking equipment maker, that involved royalty-based
revenue sharing; with Boeing for work on its breakthrough 787 Dreamliner;
and with Celestica, the innovative Toronto-based world leader in electronics
manufacturing services, a $100 million joint venture that launched HCL’s
“concept-to-manufacturing” service.
Many of these deals were won in stiff competition with global majors
like IBM and Accenture and key Indian IT firms like Wipro and TCS. They
were deals that, even a year earlier, HCL would probably not have pursued
or won. Some, such as those with Cisco and Celestica, represented the next
phase of HCL’s transformation, which was about forming strategic partnerships
that jointly created new and uncontested markets. “We were starting
to win,” said a senior HCL manager, “because Vineet had pulled all of the
Collective Genius
62
ingredients to success—which we already had—together. ‘Employees First’
was a wonderful glue.”
With these wins and other signs of change and progress, HCL began
to attract the interest of investors, the business press, and prospective
employees. India Today ranked HCL one of the top ten “most wanted Indian
stocks.” IDC, a technology information firm, called HCL a “Â�disruptive
force” and said it “may very well be one of the contenders to lead the IT
services world of the very near future.”4 The Economist cited HCL as a company
to watch, especially for its unique strategy. It said IBM and the other
global majors were “becoming increasingly nervous” about HCL. “Largely
Â�unnoticed,” it said, “HCL has won several contracts worth $300m-700m for
infrastructure management and business transformation.”5
HCL’s performance metrics showed the results of Nayar’s leadership.
In the global recession of 2008–2009, all its Indian competitors watched
their revenues drop while HCL posted an increase of over 23 percent. In the
five years before he arrived, HCL’s compound annual growth rate had been
the lowest among Indian IT firms by eleven to fourteen percentage points;
for 2008–2012, it was the highest by six to nine percentage points.
One driver of this growth was HCL’s 2008 acquisition of AXON,
a leading enterprise systems integrator, for over $800 million. Instead
of integrating the acquired firm into HCL, the standard approach in a
merger, Nayar created a separate business unit, HCL-AXON, and reverseintegrated
HCL’s own enterprise applications practice and staff into the
AXON operation. This approach, he said, “had the intended effect of
accelerating HCL’s growth even as the recession deepened.” It was the
next step in his long-term plan to provide clients with innovative, integrated
services that would have an impact on and even redefine their core
businesses.
For all HCL’s success, Nayar was quick to point out that the transformation
of the company was always an ongoing story. Not everything worked
as intended. The acquisition and reverse-integration of AXON, for example,
was tumultuous at times. Not every customer engagement went well.
We talked to many customers who saw great innovation in HCL’s work, but
some were disappointed. As HCL began to see some success, Nayar said,
it was difficult to keep people dissatisfied and eager to change. Neither he
Recasting the Role of the Leader
63
nor any of the leaders we studied believed that their Â�organizations’ past and
current successes guaranteed anything about the future.
After three years as CEO, Nayar subsequently become its vice chairman
in 2010. Then, in 2013, he relinquished his CEO position to focus on
the activities of a foundation he had begun years earlier that was devoted to
social and educational change in India.
During the time he led HCL, from 2005 to 2013, its operations
expanded to thirty-two countries while revenues increased sixfold, from
$764 million to $4.7 billion. Profits and market cap increased by the
same factor. Under him, the company achieved, with eighty-five thousand
employees, the highest revenue-per-employee of all India-based firms.
This radical transformation led Fortune to recognize HCL as “the world’s
most modern management,” while Businessweek named HCL “one of the
world’s most influential companies.” In 2012, HCL was named one of
the top-three global outsourcing leaders by the International Association
of Outsourcing Providers. That same year, Forbes included it among its
“Fab 50 Companies” in Asia. The company also received many prestigious
citations, such as the “Most Democratic Workplace in the World,”
“Workforce Management Optimas Award for HR Innovation” in the
United States, “Britain’s Top Employers,” “Best Employer in Asia,” and
many more. Nayar himself was chosen by Fortune for its first-ever global
“Executive Dream Team” 2012, which was described as an “all-star leadership”
that “could coalesce and dominate in any industry,” in addition
to his inclusion in the elite “Thinkers50 List” in 2011–2012, a definitive
listing of the world’s top fifty business Â�thinkers.
Even in Nayar’s absence, the leadership ideas he implanted continued
to grow and develop. Employees First began paradoxically as a top-down
effort to spur bottom-up initiative. Now, as we write this, employees themselves,
excited by the Employees First philosophy, are pushing that initiative
to its next stage. They’re asking for, and in some cases demanding,
corporate platforms to stimulate, celebrate, capture, and reward grassroots
innovation. Some programs emerging from that effort include MAD Jam
(Make a Difference Jamboree), an annual celebration of employee innovation,
including a contest in which employees vote on innovations generated
by different teams in the course of their regular work; Value Portal,
Collective Genius
64
a clearinghouse for employee innovations developed for one client with
the potential to benefit many; and MAD LTD (Make a Difference, Lead
the Difference), a kind of hackathon for college engineering and business
students, designed to bring students’ ideas for societal and other kinds of
change to the surface.
Lessons from a Different Kind of Leader
It’s impossible to read the story of Vineet Nayar and HCL without concluding
that the leadership he provided was not leadership as commonly seen
or conceived. Yes, he was a visionary, but he understood that was not his
primary role. He could be and was at times quite directive, especially when
he needed to remove obstacles to innovation or put structures in place that
fostered it. But we believe he succeeded not because of those aspects of his
leadership but precisely because he had the courage to take the unconventional
steps he did. Despite terrific pressure to perform, he embraced and
practiced what to most leaders would have seemed a revolutionary mind-set
and approach.6
Given what he discovered at HCL during his first weeks as president,
Nayar felt he had little choice. He was taking over a once-great
hardware company that was declining as it faced faster competitors in a
changing market. Customer companies wanted more than the isolated
software solutions HCL primarily offered, and they had grown beyond the
basics of using IT to automate old ways of doing business. They wanted
an IT services vendor whose people could innovate in using technology to
transform their companies.
Nayar understood what this required of HCL’s leaders, starting with
him. Above all, he thought differently about his role as leader. As we said, he
never saw himself as the great visionary of HCL who would lead it to a
glorious future. Instead, he saw himself, in his own phrase, as a “social
architect” creating an organizational setting that encouraged and enabled
the innovation that would be the company’s value-add in the future. He
actively, publicly refused to play the role of the one with all the answers, and
he encouraged his managers to reject that role as well. He understood that
he didn’t know enough and wasn’t smart enough—no leader is—to know
everything. We saw this in the many systems and forums he created at HCL
65
Recasting the Role of the Leader
where employees could raise and answer questions themselves. He taught
people not to look passively to leaders—to the “Hand of God,” as he put
it—for all direction. “I believe,” he said,
Leaders must avoid the urge to answer every question or provide a solution
to every problem. Instead you must start asking questions, seeing
others as the source of [innovation], and transferring ownership of the
organization’s growth …The greatest impact is that it unleashes the
power of the many and loosens the stranglehold of the few, thus increasing
the speed and quality of innovation and decision making … every day.
Nayar pressed people to take personal responsibility for organizational
change. He worked hard to change what they expected from their leaders.
Instead of answering the question, “Where are we going?” he focused on
“Who are we?” and “Why do we exist?” He wanted people to see themselves
as partners with HCL’s customers in finding innovative uses of technology
to transform their businesses.
This was why Thambi, the character developed by his Young Sparks
team, was so important. Thambi, “brother,” was the extraordinary individual,
the idealized, proactive HCL employee who was able and expected to
accomplish great things. Thambi was backed by the “Force of One,” which
was HCL as a whole—its collective genius, if you will. The Force of One
referred to the ability of one person to bring to bear the collective genius of
HCL on a client’s problems and opportunities.
Nayar recognized people’s individual slices of genius. He didn’t
believe innovation was the province of a few talented individuals. He
believed instead that most individuals brought to work their own unique
talents and had a genuine contribution to make. If he created the right
setting, systems, and opportunities, people would combine their talents,
their slices of genius, to create collective genius. This is something too
few leaders realize or act upon. Even if they appreciate intellectually that
everyone has a creative spark, they don’t see it as their job to take advantage
of that spark.
Nayar took a wide variety of actions—actually experiments—to bring
about change and was constantly reviewing and learning from the Â�outcomes.
This large organization was spread around the world. Nayar not only had to
Collective Genius
66
take a different approach to leadership himself, but he also had to foster
a similar change among the firm’s eight thousand managers, far from an
easy task in a culture that tended to give great deference to authority. As one
HCL manager said of posting his own 360-degree review: “In India, people
tended to value hierarchy, and transparency was not built into the culture.
It was uncomfortable to be exposed like that, especially as someone with
seniority.”
Over the decades of its history, HCL leadership had set direction and
then made sure everyone followed. People had been trained to look upward
for guidance about everything important. Nayar knew that some of the
managers were still struggling with their new role. He had to watch out
for regression, given the challenging economic times and the unrelenting
pressure to deliver. Indeed, some managers were scared off by the shifting
power dynamics—the loss of control and amount of transparency expected.
Some employees were frightened off as well; they were unprepared to accept
the duties and obligations that came with their new freedom and responsibilities.
Nayar was unfazed by the turnover, which he viewed in some sense
as quality control.
When innovation was the goal, he knew a conventional approach to
leadership made little sense. He knew that if everyone constantly relied on
direction, it would most likely produce only frustration and Â�failure.
The lesson for those hoping to lead innovation is clear. If you want
your organization to produce something truly new and useful, you cannot
know—by definition—exactly where to go. That’s why leading innovation
is not—cannot be—about being a visionary. The last thing you want is a
team that defers to you to set a course, to be chief innovator and then simply
implement your vision. That was the kind of organization Nayar inherited
and had to change in order to save it.
If your goal is innovation, then your role must instead be to create an
environment—a setting, a context, an organization—where people are willing
and able to do the hard work of innovation themselves: to collaborate,
learn through trial and error, and make integrated decisions.
Nayar’s story and those of the other leaders we studied have convinced
us that until leaders reframe their understanding of innovation and
leadership, innovation will remain an exception in their organizations.
We cannot say that leadership is the only difference between the many
organizations that rarely innovate and the few Pixars and HCLs where
innovation is part of their DNA. But we’re convinced it’s frequently a key
difference. Without the kind of leadership we saw in those we studied and
describe here, we believe an organization will struggle to achieve its full
capacity for innovation.
